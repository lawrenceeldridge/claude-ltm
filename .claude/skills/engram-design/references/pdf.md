# PDF Build Reference

The Markdown paper is always the source of truth. The PDF is a build artefact produced
by [`../scripts/build_pdf.py`](../scripts/build_pdf.py) via **pandoc + tectonic**. This
reference covers the toolchain, the two build modes, citations, and the publish flow.

---

## Toolchain: pandoc + tectonic

- **pandoc** converts Markdown to LaTeX.
- **tectonic** is a self-contained LaTeX engine that auto-fetches the packages a document
  needs — no full TeX Live install, no manual package management.

Install once (macOS):

```bash
brew install pandoc tectonic
```

The **first** build downloads LaTeX packages, so it needs network access; later builds
are offline and fast. If either tool is missing, `build_pdf.py` prints this install line
and exits without touching the source.

Why this engine (over the alternatives): it gives true academic LaTeX typography (the
`bitcoin.pdf` register) with the least setup — tectonic removes the "install a 4 GB TeX
distribution" barrier, and pandoc is already the lingua franca for Markdown conversion.
A pure-Python HTML-to-PDF path (WeasyPrint) was the runner-up; it needs no system install
but produces CSS-styled output rather than LaTeX typesetting.

## Build modes

From anywhere in the repo:

```bash
# Build <paper>.pdf beside the source — for iterating on a draft
python3 .claude/skills/engram-design/scripts/build_pdf.py docs/generated/design-drafts/<slug>/<slug>.md

# Explicit output path
python3 .claude/skills/engram-design/scripts/build_pdf.py <paper>.md -o /tmp/preview.pdf

# Publish — archive + canonical root copy (see below)
python3 .claude/skills/engram-design/scripts/build_pdf.py docs/whitepaper-src/<slug>.md --publish
```

The script resolves its bundled config (`assets/pandoc/paper.yaml`, `assets/pandoc/header.tex`)
relative to itself, so it works from any working directory, and sets pandoc's
`--resource-path` to the paper's own directory so figures referenced relatively resolve.

---

## Styling

- **`assets/pandoc/paper.yaml`** — pandoc *defaults*: `pdf-engine: tectonic`, A4,
  11pt `article`, 1-inch margins, a table of contents, numbered sections, coloured links.
- **`assets/pandoc/header.tex`** — a minimal `header-includes` (booktabs tables, tighter
  lists, long-identifier splitting), deliberately limited to widely-available packages so
  tectonic needs nothing exotic.

The paper's own YAML metadata block (`title`, `author`, `date`, `abstract`) drives the
title block and abstract — see [`../assets/paper_template.md`](../assets/paper_template.md).

### Margin discipline (code blocks and wide tables)

`header.tex` wraps every verbatim/code block (`fvextra`, `breaklines` +
`breakanywhere`) at `\footnotesize`, so a long line can no longer run past the right
margin; `\emergencystretch` absorbs long inline code the same way. Wrapping is the
*safety net*, not the goal — a wrapped benchmark table is in-margin but ugly. Pick the
right mechanism per block:

- **Body code blocks (Method, Results):** keep lines at **≤ 100 characters**; prefer
  several narrow blocks over one wide one, and backslash-continue long commands.
- **Raw-output appendices (the preferred fix for wide harness output):** put the
  appendix on landscape pages rather than editing the raw output — wrap the section in
  raw LaTeX markers in the markdown:

  ```
  \begin{landscape}

  # Appendix A: Raw experimental output {-}
  ...code blocks up to ~160 characters wide fit here...

  \end{landscape}
  ```

  (`pdflscape` is loaded by `header.tex`; pandoc passes the raw LaTeX through.)
- **Check the built PDF visually before publishing** — page through it (the appendix
  pages carry the widest content) and treat any clipped or wrapped line as a defect to
  fix in the source, not to ship.

### Diagrams, equations, and safe source editing

- **Diagrams** use TikZ (`\usepackage{tikz}` is in `header.tex`; tectonic auto-fetches it).
  Keep them boxes-and-arrows in the Bitcoin-paper idiom. Two gotchas: do **not** name a
  TikZ style `step` — it collides with a built-in pgf key and fails to compile with
  "the key /tikz/step requires a value"; use `box`, `nd`, and the like. And a long
  horizontal row of nodes overflows portrait width, so lay wide flows out vertically or
  wrap them in `\begin{landscape}`.
- **Equations** are written as `$$…$$` display maths and transcribed from the source
  functions. If a single display runs past the right margin, split it across two `$$`
  lines rather than shrinking it; `microtype` (in `header.tex`) absorbs only small
  overflows.
- **Never edit LaTeX or maths in the draft with `perl -i -pe 's/…/…/'`.** perl interprets
  backslashes on the *replacement* side, so `\quad` becomes `quad` and `\big` becomes a
  literal backspace control character, silently corrupting equations — often past a build
  that merely *looks* clean because the failure was misread. Use Python `str.replace`, or
  the Edit tool, for any text containing backslashes, and always rebuild and eyeball the
  affected page afterwards.

To restyle a single paper without editing the shared assets, add LaTeX to that paper's
metadata (`header-includes:`); to change the house style for all papers, edit the two
`assets/pandoc/` files.

---

## Citations (optional `.bib` + citeproc)

Citation handling is **conditional on a `references.bib` beside the source**:

- **With `references.bib`** — the build adds `--citeproc --bibliography references.bib`,
  producing numbered in-text citations and an auto-formatted, consistently-styled
  reference list. Cite in the Markdown with `[@atkinson1968]`. This is the academic path.
- **Without it** — the build omits citeproc and the author's plain Markdown `## References`
  list renders as written. No configuration change needed.

To switch a paper to managed citations: drop a `references.bib` next to it and add
`bibliography: references.bib` to the paper's metadata block (or rely on the script's
auto-detection). A CSL style file can be added per paper via `csl: <style>.csl` in the
metadata if a specific journal style is wanted; the default numbered style needs nothing.

---

## The publish flow (`--publish`)

`--publish` promotes a review-ready draft to a published artefact in three steps:

1. Build the PDF.
2. Write a datetime-stamped copy pair into `docs/whitepaper/`:
   `<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>.md` and `<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>.pdf`. Every published and
   transitional version is retained here and sorts chronologically.
3. Copy the fresh PDF to the **repo root** as `<slug>.pdf` — the canonical published
   version, alongside `README.md` and `DESIGN.md`.

The slug is the source filename stem; the repo root is located by walking up to the
`.git` marker. Commit the `docs/whitepaper/` archive pair and the root `<slug>.pdf`
together so the canonical PDF and its dated source always match.

## Failure behaviour

- **Missing pandoc/tectonic** → install guidance, exit 1, source untouched.
- **pandoc/tectonic error** (e.g. a LaTeX error in the document) → the error is surfaced,
  exit non-zero, source untouched. Fix the Markdown and rebuild.
- **Publish step fails** (e.g. no `.git` marker) → the PDF is still built beside the
  source; only the archive/promotion is skipped, and the reason is reported.

The invariant: a build never modifies or corrupts the Markdown source.

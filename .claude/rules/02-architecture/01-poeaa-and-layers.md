# POEAA Patterns & Layering

claude-engram uses **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** (POEAA) /
Cosmic Python patterns deliberately. These are not decoration — they are the reason
the plugin stays testable on the stdlib, swaps embedding backends without touching
the core, and keeps capture off the hot path. The canonical map (from
[DESIGN.md § POEAA / Cosmic Python](../../../DESIGN.md)):

| Role | Pattern | File |
|---|---|---|
| Overall shape | CQRS + Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) | whole plugin |
| Capture pipeline | Command / Handler, idempotent per fact | `core/service.py` |
| Distil / rank / quantise | Functional Core / Imperative Shell | `core/distill.py`, `recall.py`, `quantize.py` |
| Memory access | **Repository over Data Mapper** (never Active Record) | `core/store.py` |
| Query params | Query Object | `core/recall.py::search` |
| Embedding provider | **Gateway + Separated Interface** | `core/embedding.py`, `core/adapters/` |
| Injected payload | DTO (deliberately one line per fact) | `core/recall.py::render_block` |
| Empty recall | Special Case / Null Object (inject nothing) | `render_block` returns `""` |
| Durable per-memory processing (opt-in) | Gateway + Separated Interface — a **Command** queue, **not** Events | `core/membus.py`, `core/adapters/{inproc,nats}_bus.py` |
| Wiring | Composition Root | `bin/*` entry points |

## Layer seams (do not collapse)

```
bin/*  (composition roots, driving adapters: hooks, CLI, MCP server, daemon)
   │ wires
   ▼
core/  (app + persistence at root: service, store, config, project, provision, transcript, daemon_client)
  ├─ domain/   (pure Functional Core: scoring, quantize, fusion, confidence, lexical)
  ├─ ports/    (Separated Interfaces: embedding, distill, [membus])
  ├─ recall/   (read side — search/render; `from core.recall import …`)
  ├─ index/    (code/docs index: indexer, chunking, code_symbols, treesitter_symbols, drift, index_recall)
  └─ consolidation/  (the sleep pass — replay/displace/refine/purge; the RNR "rescue" stage lives in core/service.py, co-located with capture; added in Phase 4)
   │ depends on interfaces, not implementations
   ▼
core/adapters/  (driven adapters: fastembed_gw, [inproc_bus, nats_bus], …)  ← the only place heavy deps import
```

The `core/` tree groups by concern (domain/ports/recall/index), keeping the app-service +
persistence + cross-cutting modules at the root (the fastapi-best-practices convention:
`config`/`store`/`main`-equivalents at the top). It is still **one bounded context, one
`Store`** — the subpackages are internal module boundaries, not separate contexts.

- **Dependencies point inward.** `core/` never imports from `bin/`; `core/` depends
  on the *interface* (`embedding.py`, the distiller protocol), not on `fastembed`.
- **Adapters are the seam for optional deps.** `fastembed` is imported lazily in
  `core/adapters/fastembed_gw.py`. Adding a new embedding or distiller backend means
  a new adapter behind the existing interface — not an `if backend == …` in the core.
- **Composition roots wire, they don't compute.** `bin/*` reads config, picks
  adapters, and calls the core. Business logic does not live in a hook script.

## Rules

1. **Repository, not Active Record.** All memory access goes through `core/store.py`.
   Facts are plain data + a mapper; they do not carry their own persistence methods.
2. **Query Object for search params.** Extend the query object, don't grow a
   positional-argument signature on `search`.
3. **Functional core / imperative shell.** Distillation, ranking, scoring, and
   quantisation are pure functions over data; I/O (DB, model, spawning workers) lives
   in the shell. Keep new logic pure where it can be — it is what makes the core
   stdlib-testable.
4. **Null Object for empty recall.** No match → inject `""`, never a placeholder or
   an error. Irrelevant turns cost zero tokens.
5. **New pattern? Invoke [`/engram-poeaa`](../../skills/engram-poeaa/SKILL.md) first** — it
   carries the catalogue, decision trees, anti-patterns, and this project's defaults.
6. **Durable per-memory processing is a Command queue, not an Event bus.** claude-engram has
   **no** Events / pub-sub. A durable job-claim queue (`MemoryBus`) is permitted for
   detached capture / re-distil / consolidation — opt-in, behind a Separated Interface,
   default `inproc` (stdlib SQLite `work_queue`), opt-in `nats` (JetStream), **fail-open**
   to `inproc`. It extends single-flight + idempotent capture; it never touches the recall
   hot path. See [DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md) and the `stm-ltm-membus` design.

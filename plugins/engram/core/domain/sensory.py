"""Pure sensory-register decisions (Functional Core).

Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) split *structures* (the stores) from *control processes* — the
transient, subject-controlled strategies that move information between them. The sensory
register is the single intake stage all perception enters; its one control process here is
**attention** — a selective read-out that transfers a perception to the durable store. This
module holds that one pure decision. No I/O, no clock: the register table (``Store``) does the
storing and the SQL decay sweep; the intake shell sets ``attended``.

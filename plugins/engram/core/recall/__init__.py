"""Read side — embed a query, hybrid re-rank active facts, render an injection block.

Ranking is not similarity alone. Each candidate that clears the similarity gate
(the context cue) gets a Priority Score combining similarity, recency decay and
frequency (see ``core.domain.scoring``). Superseded facts are excluded at the SQL layer,
so a replaced fact can never resurface. Everything the model sees is capped by
``max_chars`` so the token budget is bounded.

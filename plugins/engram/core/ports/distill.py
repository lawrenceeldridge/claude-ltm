"""Distil raw text into atomic, injectable facts.

Distillation is lossy compression tuned for relevance — the biggest storage,
token and recall lever (atomic facts embed far better than raw line-splits).

Strategies behind one interface (Strategy pattern):
  - HeuristicDistiller  : dependency-free, keeps short declarative lines. Cannot
    detect conflicts, so it relies on similarity-based supersession downstream.
  - ClaudeCliDistiller  : shells out to ``claude -p`` (defaults to Haiku — the
    right tier for cheap extraction).
  - HTTPDistiller       : POSTs to any OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint via stdlib
    urllib. Point it at a local Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp / vLLM server for
    zero-token, fully offline distillation.

The LLM distillers produce genuinely atomic facts AND explicit ``supersedes``
links — the fix for vocabulary-disjoint conflicts (Paris -> London) that
similarity can't catch. All run in the detached capture worker and fall back to
the heuristic on any failure, so capture never breaks.

Each string in `facts` is an atomic memory used for retrieval, so keep each one
self-contained and specific; capture every distinct point (up to 7). `title` is a
terse headline, `subtitle` is a readable one-sentence summary, and `narrative` is
a fuller prose explanation — write all three. Use [] / "" when a field truly does
not apply. One observation may hold a single fact.

Choose `type` by intent:
- feature   : new capability or feature added
- change    : a concrete change to existing behaviour/config
- refactor  : restructuring without behaviour change
- bugfix    : a bug hit and how it was fixed
- decision  : a choice made and, briefly, why
- discovery : something learned about the code/system (default)

Rules:
- Capture outcomes that help a future session, not narration. Skip questions,
  chatter, tool noise, and anything transient.
- Attribute concretely ("Uses X because Y"), not vaguely ("made some changes").
- If an observation updates or contradicts existing facts, put their ids in

Rules:
- `scope` = "global" ONLY for tool/harness/language-general lessons that apply in ANY project
  (e.g. misusing a CLI flag). Use "project" for anything specific to THIS codebase. When in
  doubt, use "project".
- `strict_rule` must be self-contained and name the trigger context — it is what a future
  session sees first, before any other field.
- Keep `dont`/`do` concrete and short; a literal command or flag is ideal.
- If there is no genuine, generalisable mistake, return {{"antipatterns": []}}.

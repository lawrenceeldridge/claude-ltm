"""Calibrated recall confidence (Functional Core — pure).

A single 0-1 score summarising how trustworthy a ranked recall is, so a caller
(the MCP recall tool, a hook) can decide whether to trust memory or widen to a
full search. Adapted from jcodemunch's retrieval/confidence: a weighted geometric
mean of independent 0-1 signals, so any single weak signal drags the number down
(the whole point — a lone strong hit with no runner-up gap shouldn't read as
certain).

Signals:
  * gap      — how far the top hit beats the second (ties → low).
  * strength — absolute score of the top hit, soft-squashed to 0-1.
  * identity — 1.0 when the top hit shares a content token with the query
               (an exact lexical anchor), 0.7 when unknown, 0.6 on a known miss.

Freshness is intentionally omitted: recency already lives inside the priority
score these values come from, so folding it in again would double-count it.

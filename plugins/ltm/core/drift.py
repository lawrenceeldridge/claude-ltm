"""Embedding-drift canary.

A long-lived vector store assumes the embedder is stable: vectors written months
apart must stay comparable. If the model (or its version) silently changes under
you, old fact vectors become incomparable to new ones and recall quietly rots.

This pins a small set of fixed strings' vectors at first use and, on demand,
re-embeds them and alarms if the mean cosine similarity to the pinned vectors
drops below a threshold — a cheap tripwire, no model internals required. Adapted
from jcodemunch's retrieval/embed_drift.

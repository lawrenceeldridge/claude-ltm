"""Retention score — how important is a fact, for the sleep pass (design §3A).

Pure Functional Core: features are gathered by the shell (a fact row + a couple of
store lookups) and passed in; this module only does math, so it is stdlib-testable
with no I/O. Reuses the existing ranking primitives in ``core.domain.scoring`` (one
authoritative log-saturation / decay curve) rather than re-deriving them.

    R = w_use·use + w_recency·recency + w_salience·salience
      + w_depth·depth + w_surprise·surprise + w_frequency·frequency

Signal → memory-research mechanism:
  use        recall_count            → retrieval-induced consolidation (testing effect)
  recency    age since last recall/seen → forgetting curve
  salience   corrections / reward     → emotional / dopamine tagging (v2, default 0)
  depth      distiller richness       → levels of processing
  surprise   # facts this superseded  → novelty / prediction error
  frequency  capture frequency        → consolidation
